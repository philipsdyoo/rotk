Records of the Kingdoms

A very quick simple game I made using Node.JS for fun. It is based on the final game of the Liar Games: The Records of the Four Kingdoms.

You can attack or block a player for the cost of 1 life point each. A attack that is not blocked deals 3 damage to the target. The goal is to be the last one standing. A lot of mind games and strategy are involved in the playing of this game.
